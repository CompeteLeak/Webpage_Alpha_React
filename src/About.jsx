  return <div>🕶️ Agent Profile: L0ewki

Codename: L0ewki (pronounced “Low-key”)
Archetype: Urban operative with elite finesse, grounded morals, and tactical mastery.

L0ewki is a modern fusion of James Bond’s composure, Eggsy’s street-bred brilliance, and Sterling Archer’s improvisational edge—but built with real-world practicality.

He operates with:
	•	🔹 Street-smart adaptability — Reads a room, a threat, or a person instantly. Never caught flat-footed.
	•	🔹 Tech-savvy precision — Understands and leverages modern tools, systems, and digital ops to gain the upper hand.
	•	🔹 High-stakes finesse — Can defuse or manipulate social tension with calm, charm, or quiet intimidation.
	•	🔹 Strong moral compass — Never betrays his values or allies. Ruthless with his enemies, loyal to his code.
	•	🔹 Clean, modern style — Moves between corporate, street, and covert spaces without ever compromising presence or comfort.

He doesn’t shout.
He doesn’t chase clout.
He just wins, quietly and efficiently.</div>;
